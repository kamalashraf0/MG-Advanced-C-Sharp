# .NET Development Journey

Welcome to our .NET Development Learning Project! This project serves as a comprehensive study guide for individuals looking to master advanced concepts in C# programming with a focus on object-oriented principles.

# Overview

Our journey begins with a deep dive into Advanced C# programming, exploring topics such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and more. With a strong foundation in place, we progress to mastering LINQ (Language Integrated Query) for efficient data querying and manipulation within the .NET framework.

# Database Access

To enhance our understanding of data access in .NET, we explore various Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) frameworks including ADO.NET, Dapper, NHibernate, and EF Core. Through practical examples and exercises, we gain hands-on experience in leveraging these tools to interact with databases, execute queries, and manage data entities effectively.
